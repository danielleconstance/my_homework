<h2> Where It All Began <h2>

<p>
In 2013 I received my bachelors degree from Yale University in Drama. After graduation I toured the world staring in the Lion King Broadway. I starred as Scar, the best character in the movie. After my years on broadway, I entered the maketing world. I have learned much but now I've decided to take on the tech industry and learn something new!
