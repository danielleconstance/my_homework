About Me Page

Originally hailing from New York, I am a new California resident who's enjoying it to the fullest. Before moving to LA i was living in Atlanta. The ATL had a great music scene but living down south is not for everyone. Life in the south moves at a snails pace and the humidity is beyond intense. What makes matters worse is that there is no beach for 6 hours away! In New York, I was tired of living in -0 degree weather for 9 months out of the year. Even though NY is home, everyone needs a change now and then! California has the perfect combination of weather, water, and activities. Aside from Hawaii it is the best state in the USA and I beg anyone to differ!
